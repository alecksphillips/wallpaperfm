===========

Python script for generating wallpapers from last.fm data

Requirements:
* Python >3.0
* Python Imaging Library (Not available for Python 3; 'Pillow' is a drop-in replacement)

Please try to use the local option '-l' when possible to be kind to last.fm's servers.

Thanks to [Koant] [1] for his [original script] [2] and to
[HelgeBS] [3] for the addition of the background color and image type options,
and to [Roignac] [4] for the artist image and rounded corners options.
